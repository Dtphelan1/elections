### Ideal Election
- On Democracy
    - D: While Democracy technically dates back to Ancient Greece & Rome, when discussing the system we are often referring specifically to Representative Democracy, wherein elections decide the representatives that handle the actual running of the State. This system is much more modern, dating back to the 17th century.

    - D: The 19th Amendment for Women's suffrage remained in limbo for a full 40 years before being finally being passed by both the House of Representatives and the Senate. This passage wasn't Society's Inevitable Convergence Towards The Good; it was due to the tireless efforts of strong willed women, several of whom were imprisoned, neglected and tortured. People smarter than me have written far more informatively on the history here.

    - D: While people of color's right to vote is often discussed in the context of the 20th century, that right had already been amended into the constitution during the late 1800's reconstruction. The 1965's Voting Rights Act of 1965 (and the Civil Rights Act of 1964) fought back against the practice of 'disenfranchisement by any other name' - poll taxes, segregation, literacy tests, voter intimidation, and the like. The success of the Act, as I understand, was in providing a firm legal basis for charging those guilty of disenfranchising others. Again, I'm no expert here and will point to others who have covered this subject more holistically.

- NOTE:
    - Just a subtle point: Elections that only elect people with ≥ 50% of the vote fall under the category of Majoritarianism. Pluralism, the practice of electing whoever gets the largest proportion of votes, will pick a majority candidate if there is one; but it will also settle for whoever got the most votes, setting a lower bar than Majoritarian systems.

    - Dale R. Durran does a fantastic job crafting an interactive exploration of 'vote weight'. Bastardizing his work here would only be an insult, so peruse the original work instead.

### FPTP:
- NOTE: The term for this is plurality, in contrast with majoritarianism which will only accept a candidate who has ≥ 50% of the vote.

- NOTE: Important difference that would matter in an in-depth analysis is that the majority party did have a winning candidate, whereas here the minority party won.

- NOTE: This is a simplification of how ranked voting is implemented in practice. It's possible that some candidates remain unranked by voters. How equally-ranked candidates are handled differs from one system to another.
