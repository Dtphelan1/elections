### Ideal Election
- On Democracy
    - D: While Democracy technically dates back to Ancient Greece & Rome, the form of Democracy we typically talk about is Representative Democracy, wherein elections decide the representatives that handle the actual running of the State. This system is more modern and dates back to closer to the 17th century.

    - D: The 19th Amendment for Women's suffrage remained in limbo for a full 40 years before being finally being passed by both the House of Representatives and the Senate. This passage wasn't Society's Inevitable Convergence Towards The Good; it was due to the tireless efforts of strong willed women, several of whom were imprisoned, neglected and tortured. People smarter than me have written far more informatively on the history here.

    - D: While people of color's right to vote is often discussed in the context of the 20th century, that right had already been amended into the constitution during the late 1800's reconstruction. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 (and the Civil Rights Act of 1964) fought back against the practice of 'disenfranchisement by any other name' - poll taxes, segregation, literacy tests, voter intimidation, and the like. The success of the Act, as I understand, was in providing a firm legal basis for charging those guilty of disenfranchising others. Again, I'm no expert here and will point to others who have covered this subject more holistically.

- NOTE:
    - Just a subtle point: Elections that only elect people with â‰¥ 50% of the vote fall under the category of Majoritarianism. Pluralism, the practice of electing whoever gets the largest proportion of votes, will pick a majority candidate if there is one; but it will also settle for whoever got the most votes, setting a lower bar than Majoritarian systems.

    - Dale R. Durran does a fantastic job crafting an interactive exploration of 'vote weight'. Bastardizing his work here would only be an insult, so peruse the original work instead.

    - This term and subsequent Condorcet-stemmed terminology are eponymous, a tribute to French mathematician/philosopher The Marquis de Condorcet. Historically Condorcet has been credited for observing these important properties of voting systems, but the recently rediscovered notes of 13th century polymath Raymond Llull show Llull came to similar conclusions centuries earlier.

    - Not to be confused with Ranked Choice Voting (RCV), the popular name for Instant Runoff Voting/Single Transferrable Vote systems in the US. RCV is a type of Ranked Voting system, but is far from the only one.

- NOTE:
    - 'Alleviate' here is used with great intention; these effects can and do still occur with ranked voting systems, but the argument is that their frequency and severity is diminished. We'll discuss this fact later.

    - The fact that the victor, Bob Kiss, was neither the Condorcet winner nor the plurality winner multiplied the controversy. IRV critics seized this outcome as an opportunity to highlighting some of the shortcomings of this system. More details on the fallout of this election can be found below.
