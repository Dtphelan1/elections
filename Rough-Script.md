- Title: Democratic Elections and Voting Theory
- SubT: Why voting systems fail, And how we can fix them


## Background and Motivations: 
2020 is a major election year in the US, when we decide who will lead us for the next 1460 days. As of writing, it has been over 200 days since the COVID-19 pandemic hit our nation. We're grappling with the fallout of record breaking unemployment numbers. Nationwide protests for accountability in our law enforcement systems have been met with armed federal force. A thousand American lives are lost daily. Chaos abounds. Hope feels scarce.

Many Americans are looking for answers. Certainty. 

In pursuit of that certainty, we will turn our attention to the history and mathematics of democratic elections. We'll use that knowledge to investigate how elections should work, how the American Presidential does work, the chasm between those two ideas and how we can cross it.

## The Ideal Democratic Election

Democratic elections in some form have existed for millennia. In a hopeful sense, they are a mechanism by which the needs of a society can be voiced, aggregated and mobilized to directly enact legislation or to elect legislators into power. Historically however, the electorate - i.e. the voting populace - is *limited* to a cadre of people deemed "capable" of society-wide decision making, a distinction typically made by people in power to serve either their interests or their biases. 

Putting aside the question of who the electorate is, we will focus on voting systems themselves. Namely: What do we want in a democratic election system? We'll start with few straightforward demands:
- The votes determine the victor
- Each person can cast their votes only once
- The person with the least votes should not be elected
- If a person gets a majority of the votes, then they should be elected. 
- 

Some contentious points: 
- Only elect a person if they get 50% of a vote. 
- Individuals can only cast their ballot for one

## Closing Thoughs: 

Elections, like all societal systems, are subject to abuse in the worst case and bias in the best case. Our history as a country paints a sobering image of how elections have failed the people, and the mathematics of elections demonstrate the inevitability of
