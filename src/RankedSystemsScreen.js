            <h1>Ranked Voting Systems: Tradeoffs and Options Abound</h1>

            <p>
                There are an entire class of preferential voting systems - Condorcet Methods - that satisfy the Condorcet Criterion.
                <b> "Copeland's method"</b>, for example, calculates the pairwise victories and pairwise defeats for each candidate.
                Using these values, each candidate receives a score corresponding to their victories minus their defeats;
                the candidate with the highest score wins.
                While Copeland's method satisfies both the Condorcet Criterion and is Smith Efficient, it often produces a tie when there are three-way Smith cycles.
                This poses a practical concern for this technique.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>"Kemenyâ€“Young's method"</b> is another Condorcet Method, one that assigns scores to each possible sequence of preferences that voters could provide.
                Those scores are then compared, based on the voting results, and the sequence with the highest possible score is chosen.
                The most-preferred candidate in that sequence is then chosen as the overall winner.
                This method, in addition to being more mathematically complicated than previous approaches, is algorithmically NP-hard.
                It's unlikely that there is a polynomial-time algorithm to find a victor for an arbitrary election with 'n' candidates, posing implementation and scaling concerns.
            </p>

            <p>
                These are ony a few of the many different Condorcet Methods, and each one has significant research and a following behind it.
                There are also some Ranked Voting systems that aren't Condorcet Methods.
                Arguably one of the most popular Ranked Voting systems, <b>"Instant Runoff Voting"/"Ranked Choice Voting"</b>, fails in this regard.
                But what it lacks in that regard, it gains in intuitive simplicity.
                The algorithm is as follows:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>If there is a majority candidate, select them.</li>
                <li>Else, remove the candidate in last place, reallocating their votes to each voter's next-in-line preference.</li>
                <li>Repeat 1-2 until a candidate is selected.</li>
            </ol>

                    <p>
                        The concern with IRV, however, is that the elimination of an outlier can result in a temporary boost of a suboptimal candidate.
                        This can occasionally knock overall front-runners into last place and remove them from the race.
                        That's how IRV can fail the Condorcet Criterion.
                        Here is an example where, after the arrival of <span className="text-secondary">Sapphire Sally</span> and a shifting of the political landscape, <span className="text-primary">Calista</span> loses to <span className="text-primary">Rosie</span>, who she could have beaten 1-on-1 thanks to <span className="text-secondary">Bennie's</span> shifted supporters.

                        This permutation on the Spoiler Effect is not just mathematically possible, but much like the Singapore example from earlier has happened in recent history.
                        Specifically, Burlington, Vermont's 2009 mayoral election saw this outcome, inspiring the city to repeal IRV and reinstate FPTP.

                But let's back up a second - why are we even discussing methods that don't meet our Condorcet Criterion?
                As we recognized when we began this exploration, it's critical that our analysis of voting systems be grounded in certainty.
                Precise analysis permits objective, nonpartisan discussions about different voting algorithms, their pros, and their cons.
                While not meeting the Condorcet Criterion is a con, failing in that regard doesn't disqualify a system unilaterally.
            </p>

            <p>
                Analysis doesn't tell us which tradeoffs we should make.
