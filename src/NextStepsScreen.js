                Hopefully this investigation has provided some new information with respect to voting systems.

                We've discussed briefly the motivations behind elections, and how those motivations are often at odds with political realities.
                But swiftly we backed away from the muck and mire of real world constraints to discuss abstract properties of elections.
                We've highlighted two approaches to ballot structure - the First Past The Post style of selecting one candidate, and the ranked preference approach where you rank candidates from favorite to least favorite.

                We've gone over the FPTP system used in the American Presidential election.
                We've demonstrated how FPTP systems can contribute to Tactical Voting, the Emergence of a Two Party System, and that FPTP does not guarantee the Condorcet Criterion.
                We've shown how alternative voting systems can improve on some of these voting criteria.
                The systems that undergird our electoral system have emergent effects on the outcomes we should expect from those systems.
                The systems that exist now should not be taken for granted.
                Check to see if there are any movements near you to propose alternative voting systems.
                If you're in MA, research Ranked Choice/Instant Runoff voting and
                Ranked Choice Voting is on the upcoming MA state ballot.
                These systems are of our own design.
                They should be questioned and we should use rigor and evidence to drive those inquiry.
                And when that inquiry leads you to unsatisfying conclusions, ones that leave you wanting more, exercise our civic duties and demand more from our elected officials.
